-> typescript is a superset of javascript bcz typescript contain all features of js and also contains additional features.
-> browser not support typescript .ts code is convert into js and then run the code
-> ts share same syntax as js
-> ts provide extra capabilities by adding type to js


why to use typescript?
ts allows developers to bind the type to variable and function return statements. that helps to remove all the type error during runtime.

js me jo bhi error ati hai vo run time pr hi ati hai but in ts error compile time pr hi pta lg jati hai


in typescript file
let last="tanya";
 last=10; //this last give compile time error:string variable not assign the number


 in ts
 let obj={
    name:'tanya'

}
console.log(obj.address); //this gives compile time error address is not exist


 but in js file
 let last="tanya";
 last=10; //this give no compile time error 

 in js 
 let obj={
    name:'tanya'

}
console.log(obj.address); //no compile time error
