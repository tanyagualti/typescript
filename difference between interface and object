An object is a specific instance containing data. It is a value assigned to a variable and contains properties with specific values.
let student = {
  name: 'Tanya',
  email: 'tanya@gmail.com'
};


An interface defines the shape or structure that objects should adhere to. It is a TypeScript
construct used to type-check objects during development, ensuring that they meet certain criteria.
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  greet(): void;
}

const person: Person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log("Hello!");
  }
};
